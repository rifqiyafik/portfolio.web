Hi there ✌️ nice to meet you!  
I'm a _Web Developer_ and _IT Enthusiast_ based in Medan, Indonesia 🇮🇩.

I’m passionate about creating digital solutions that are **efficient, secure, and user-friendly**.  
Well-versed in both **frontend and backend web development**, I specialize in **Laravel**, **CodeIgniter**, and **React.js**, with a solid foundation in **database management**, **network systems**, and **IT support**.

I’ve also explored the world of **machine learning** and **cybersecurity**, where I strive to combine intelligent systems with secure architectures.  
Certified by **BNSP** as a **Junior Web Developer** and **Junior Network Administrator**, and by **Associate Data Science Engineer (ADSE)**, I continuously seek to improve my technical and analytical skills through professional programs such as **Bangkit Academy (Machine Learning Cohort)** and **Infinite Learning (Web Development)**.

Outside of work, I love diving into new technologies, learning cybersecurity challenges, and occasionally taking part in Capture The Flag (CTF) competitions. Let’s make something impactful together 🚀
